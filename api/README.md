# Model Request Handler

This directory contains the code for the request handler that takes the image
and runs the MNIST digit recognition model. It is based off of
https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python.

The `Pipfile` is used to define the dependent packages needed to run the
models. To get started, follow the documentation for `pipenv` at
https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html.
